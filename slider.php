            <p class="desc">Homeopathic medicines are aimed at improving the level
                of health by stimulating the self-regulatory mechanism.
                Improving the level of health implies reducing any disease process as
                well as the susceptibility to illness and disease.
                That means that it is not limited to certain diseases but is universally
                applicable to all kinds of diseases</p>

            <p class="desc">
                In many cases of chronic disease homeopathic
                treatment can achieve results which would be considered
                impossible with conventional treatment.
                In injuries and accidents, homeopathic treatment can be of immense value.
                Homeopathy can even help if surgery is necessary.

            <h3 class="title">Homeopathy: a complete system of medicine</h3>
            <p class="desc">Homeopathy is a complementary or alternative medical system that originated in the late 18th century.
                It is based on the principle of "like cures like,"
                which means that a substance that causes symptoms in
                a healthy person can be used in diluted form to treat those
                same symptoms in a sick person.</p>

            <p class="desc">
                In homeopathic treatment, highly diluted substances are used,
                often to the point where there is little or none of the original substance remaining.
                The idea is that the water or alcohol in which the substance was dissolved retains a "memory" of the substance,
                and this memory is what provides therapeutic benefit.

            <p class="desc">The practice of homeopathy is controversial and has been criticized by many conventional
                medical practitioners and researchers for a lack of scientific evidence to support its claims.
                Critics argue that the dilution of remedies makes them nothing more than sugar pills and
                that any therapeutic effect is due to the placebo effect.</p>

            <p class="desc">
                Homeopathic remedies are selected based on a person's specific symptoms and
                overall health profile, which means that treatment is tailored to the individual.
                This can be beneficial for people who want a more personalized approach to their healthcare.
